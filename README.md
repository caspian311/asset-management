# Asset Management

This is my attempt at microservices. 
The hopeful end result is to have an application that will allow administrators 
users to login and manage users and their allocated resources (laptops, phones, 
other company owned devices).

### Goal

The goal is to learn: microservice architecture, multi-service deployments using
 Docker, box provisioning using Ansible.
